# Geographic Information Systems and Science (GIS) CASA0005
A repository for weekly homework for Geographic Information Systems and Science

# Intended learning outcomes

After having taking this module, you should be able to:

- Develop a working knowledge of QGIS and R to support the application of GI Science techniques
- Visualise geographic information through producing appropriate maps to high cartographic standards
- Carry out spatial data management tasks (joining attribute to geometry data, cleaning data, converting between file formats and spatial reference systems)
- Interpret data and apply relevant spatial analyses (e.g. auto correlation/hot spot analysis, areal interpolation, point in polygon/buffer analysis) to answer a variety of spatial problems
- Explain and evaluate common issues with geographic data such as representation and uncertainty
- Apply and critique (spatial) statistical analysis techniques to infer relationships between spatial phenomena
- Experience the diversity of the global spatial data landscape and evaluate the relative drawbacks and merits of different spatial datasets
